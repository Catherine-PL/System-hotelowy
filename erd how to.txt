Because this ER tutorial focuses on beginners below are some tips that will help you build effective ER diagrams:

Identify all the relevant entities in a given system and determine the relationships among these entities.

An entity should appear only once in a particular diagram.

Provide a precise and appropriate name for each entity, attribute, and relationship in the diagram. Terms that are simple and familiar always beats vague, technical-sounding words. In naming entities, remember to use singular nouns. However, adjectives may be used to distinguish entities belonging to the same class (part-time employee and full time employee, for example). Meanwhile attribute names must be meaningful, unique, system-independent, and easily understandable.

Remove vague, redundant or unnecessary relationships between entities.
Never connect a relationship to another relationship.

Make effective use of colors. You can use colors to classify similar entities or to highlight key areas in your diagrams.
